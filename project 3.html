            <h2 class="section-title">A Growing Crisis</h2>
            <div class="content-block">
                <p>Do you know that mental health problems, suicidal thoughts, and behaviors are highly widespread among college students? They are suffering from all sorts of mental-related disasters, such as stress, depression, insomnia, anxiety disorders, and eating and sleep disorders. Mental health problems are found to be the most burdensome disease among adolescents in the United States.</p>
                
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523050854058-8df90110c9f1?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2070&q=80" alt="University campus">
                </div>
                
                <p>According to studies, students are at high risk of harmful consequences from these problems, such as high dropout rates, lower academic performance, and worse functioning in later life, which may in turn have lifelong negative consequences for employment, income, and overall well-being. As three-quarters of lifetime mental disorders usually start to appear between the ages of 18 to 24—the typical college age—universities have both an opportunity and responsibility to address this crisis.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">The Resource Shortage</h2>
            
            <p>There is a growing trend of college students suffering from mental health problems and looking for help, while universities' services are not meeting the demand. For example, the number of students seeking help has doubled in recent years, while the number of total enrolled students has remained similar. On the other hand, the expansion of services offered by universities has often been slow.</p>
            
            <div class="stat-box">
                <div class="stat-number">1:4,000</div>
                <p>At Utah Valley University, one counselor deals with 4,000 students, far exceeding the recommended ratio of one counselor to 1,500 students.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>In the U.S., the number of students seeking help or receiving treatment from university counselling services rose 35 percent since 2014, while the number of counsellors changed little. Those unbalanced statistics make waiting times undesirable and lead to shortages in the supply of services.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Real Student Experiences:</strong> At Utah Valley University, a student named Ashtyn Aure, who was suffering from anxiety and sleepless nights for days, went to the school's mental health clinic. She was told that the waiting time could be months long, and then she returned without getting any help. Another example is that a student's suicide at Brigham Young University led to an anonymous letter complaining of the long wait time in therapy services.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">The Psychological Wall</h2>
            
            <p>What's more interesting is that a study by the World Health Organization researched first-year students from around the world. They found out that even though mental health struggles are common, only one in four students stated that they would go for help if they had serious mental health issues. In addition to this, the researchers also found out that most students who do not seek help from professionals are afraid to seek support.</p>
            
            <div class="stat-box">
                <div class="stat-number">1 in 4</div>
                <p>Only one in four students with serious mental health issues would seek professional help, according to a World Health Organization study of first-year students worldwide.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quote">
                "Even though mental health struggles are becoming more openly discussed, the humiliation that people carry in their minds of being judged is one of the biggest reasons why students will not ask for help in the first place."
            </div>
            
            <p>Another reason why students avoid seeking professional treatment is because they feel embarrassed or nervous. Many are afraid that other people will judge them and consider them weak. Moreover, some students also worry that seeking help at the counselling center might affect their academic reputation. This means that even if the college is providing free counselling on campus, students may not go there because of how they feel about it.</p>

            <p>Even though most universities are trying their best to provide mental health services effectively delivered to students, the still existence of students' struggles to receive services cannot be denied. The suggestions for universities to solve those problems mentioned above can be further illustrated by real-world examples.</p>
            
            <div class="case-study">
                <h3>Kent State University's Comprehensive Approach</h3>
                <p>Kent State University is one of the universities that effectively handles students' mental health problems. What they did was increase the counseling staff by 50% over 4 years, expand the mental health clinics to every regional campus, ensure the staff diversity reflected the student population, and enhance protective factors through innovative actions such as online screening and training staff, faculty, and students to identify students at risk of mental health issues.</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> The volume of psychological appointments increased by 9%, and the number of individuals served rose by 4%.</p>

                <h3>University of Aberdeen's Systemic Model</h3>
                <p>The University of Aberdeen in the UK introduced several mental health governance groups, such as mental health working group, stress management task and finish group, and workload reduction working group to bring action plans and mental health policy decisions to real life. They enhanced the capacity of mental health service resources, such as increasing the staff volume, developing online webpages for mental health support, and promoting mental health wellbeing activities like 'Walk This May', encouraging outdoor meetings.</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> Those activities made positive impacts on students' and staff's well-being as high levels of engagement had been seen since they were introduced.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>Studies show that technology-based interventions can help overcome psychological barriers. Research like <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0119895" target="_blank">"Internet and Computer-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety and Depression in Youth"</a> found that online options for therapy and group workshops can significantly help reduce embarrassment and reach students who often stay quiet about their struggles.</p>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="section-title">A Call for Smarter Solutions</h2>
            
            <p>In conclusion, most universities fail to provide fully accessible mental health services to let students walk in with no barrier, despite universities having resources such as counselors, facilities, and buildings for mental health services. They should try to approach students with mental health problems through better and more efficient ways.</p>
            
            <p>The research is clear about the academic consequences: studies like <a href="https://websites.umich.edu/~daneis/symposium/2010/ARTICLES/eisenberg_golberstein_hunt_2009.pdf" target="_blank">"Mental Health and Academic Success in College"</a> found that depression is a significant predictor of lower GPA and higher probability of dropping out. Other research using genetic markers has attempted to isolate the causal impact of conditions like ADHD and depression on educational outcomes.</p>
            
            <p>This is not just about hiring more staff—though that is certainly needed. It's about implementing smarter approaches that address both the resource shortage and the psychological barriers. Universities must integrate mental health support into the fabric of campus life, utilize technology to create lower-barrier entry points, and ensure their services are culturally competent and destigmatized.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>The examples of Kent State University and the University of Aberdeen show what's possible when institutions take a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach to student mental health. All schools should try their best to imitate those practical immediate actions, ensuring effective approaches toward delivering mental health treatments to students.</p>
