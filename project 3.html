            <h2 class="section-title">The Hidden Struggle</h2>
            <div class="content-block">
                <p>If you have paid attention to the youth's mental health, you noticed the degree of mental health problems is getting worse these days. Yes, those young people are suffering from severe mental illnesses increasingly.</p>
                
                <p>If you think college students are living in their best highlighted part of their lives, it could not be more wrong. They are one huge population of poor mental health victims, as they are at a critical turning point in their lives. So, of course, they have to feel financial and academic stress.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>Besides, they are one of the biggest consumers of social media, which is one big factor that burdens mental health quality. It is created to connect individuals more easily, yet pulls away from actual reality and pushes more toward virtual reality.</p>

    <!-- The Problem -->
    <section id="problem" style="background-color: #f0f7ff;">
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="section-title">What Are Universities Doing?</h2>
            
            <p>What are colleges and universities doing to help their students get healthy mental conditions? They actually are offering counseling services and are ready to give the help needed.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>You might have probably seen the headlines saying universities' counseling services are overwhelmed, and the waitlists are usually long for months. The common suggestion is that colleges should hire more staff and open more offices.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>While that is part of the problem that schools are failing to provide enough resources, from my recent research on mental health for my one school project, I think I have witnessed a more truthful reality. Actually, we are dealing with two main issues: one is the resource shortage, and another is, a deeper one, the war of psychological barriers fighting within themselves inside the students.</p>
            
            <div class="stat-box">
                <div class="stat-number">1 in 4</div>
                <p>Only one in every four people suffering from serious mental health issues would look for help. The rest of them think those problems should be addressed on their own, and seeking help makes them too vulnerable.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541339907198-e08756dedf3f?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2070&q=80" alt="Student feeling stressed">
            </div>
            
            <p>According to my research, mental health problems are the most common diseases among adolescents in the U.S, which are directly linked to poor academic results. As a response from universities, they do offer counselling services, but most institutes are under-resourced in terms of staff, resulting in an imbalance ratio of demand and supply. Then, the long wait time to meet a counsellor becomes just a normal thing for mental health help seekers.</p>

    <!-- Psychological Barriers -->
    <section id="barriers">
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="section-title">The Invisible Wall</h2>
            
            <p>What's a deeper problem is the invisible psychological wall of bricks blocking the path to the counselling offices' doors.</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                "Even though mental health is becoming more openly discussed, the humiliation of being judged as weak still exists."
            </div>
            
            <p>Therefore, being trapped in the thoughts of probable embarrassment and nervousness is the reason why the available help could not reach the one needed in the first place.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1573497019940-1c28c033b8e6?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2070&q=80" alt="Empty counseling office">

            <h2 class="section-title">Smart Moves That Work</h2>
            
            <p>Some universities showed us certain smart moves to approach mental health problems.</p>
            
            <h3 class="solution-title">Kent State University</h3>
            <p>Kent State University did not just hire more staff, but they also made sure the counsellors are reflective of the students' backgrounds, like cultural, language, and ethnicities. Plus, they introduced online tools to help solve mental struggles privately, which has shown actual progress in students' mental health and well-being.</p>
            
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1582750433449-648ed127bb54?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=2067&q=80" alt="Diverse students supporting each other">
            </div>
            
            <h3 class="solution-title">University of Aberdeen</h3>
            <p>The University of Aberdeen created peer-support networks and promoted mental well-being through activities like 'Walk This May,' reducing the psychological barriers to seeking help.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>Learning from those examples, we should shift the common demand just to hire more staff to a smarter solution, which needs smarter approaches, as the problem is not based on physical materials but is built on emotional things like fear, embarrassment, and misunderstanding. Therefore, this is not just about the quantity, but about the accessibility and approaches.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>This means the most efficient solutions would be multi-mode modes, not just building more clinics and hiring staff. This includes integrating mental health into the whole campus environment through faculty, professors, and students, and normalizing digital tools like online therapy and self-help workshops.</p>
